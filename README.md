# Predicting NFL Player Position
Project 4: In-progress

Graded __/100


## Project Description:
This project is to use supervised machine learning's predictive modeling ability to analyze NFL player data for predicting player position.
Visual comparison of data clustering was applied to contrast grouping per position using Unsupervised ML.

The data used in this project was generated from the sources listed below and is intended for educational purposes only.


## Tools and Methods Used:

- R: 
	libraries: ...

- Python:
	modules: nfl-data-py, pandas, matplotlib, keras-tuner

- SQL Database: 
	PostgreSQL server

- Git collaboration


## Setup:
### Data Import and Clean:
	- 


## Machine Learning Method
	. 

### Visualization:
	- Scatter plot clustering of player positions, actual vs. predicted
	- Numpy, Matplotlib Circle diagrams
	- Matplotlib Pareto bar chart
	


# Model Optimization:
	1) Increase yearly range of data supplied.
	2) Analyzed weighted affect of input data categories to reduce input dataframe.
	3) Use keras-tuner on the reduced dataframe to optimize model parameters.

# Setup Instructions:
## Cleaning and Loading the Data:
```
1) In the Data collection folder, open and run "..."
2) Open and run "..."
3) Run "..." last.
4) Open "..." in ... Run all cells to output the four CSV data files.

```

#todo
## SQL Database Setup and Data Import instructions:
```
1) in pgAdmin, create new Database titled "Project_4"
2) Right-click the Project_4 Database and select "Query Tool"
3) Above the Query tool text input window, click "Open File"
4) Open the Project_3_tables_schema.sql file here. Execute the query here to populate tables.
